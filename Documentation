The goal of this program is to provide customers with an easy-to-use interface for ordering art supplies and scheduling delivery appointments, streamlining the purchasing process for both the business and the consumer. 
The program provides a variety of features, including a selection of eight different art supplies with corresponding prices and mediums, an interactive appointment scheduling feature with a calendar interface, and the ability to generate a detailed receipt summarizing order and appointment details. 
Its target audience includes artists, hobbyists, educators, and anyone looking to buy art supplies, making it especially useful for those who value convenience and organization during their shopping trips. 
One of the program's advantages is its modular design, which divides concerns into distinct classes and functions, thereby improving maintainability and readability.
Furthermore, the inclusion of a calendar for scheduling appointments adds a modern and user-friendly touch, making it accessible to users who may be unfamiliar with traditional text-based input methods. 
However, the program has flaws, such as its reliance on a graphical user interface, which may only be appropriate for someÂ users or environments.
Furthermore, error handling could be improved to provide more informative feedback, allowing users to better understand any issues they encounter while interacting with the program.
